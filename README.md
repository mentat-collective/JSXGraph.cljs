[JSXGraph][jsxgraph-url] is a JavaScript library that lets you build
2-dimensional scenes full of geometric objects, function curves and interactive
UI elements, potentially with many complex constraints defined between these
objects.

[JSXGraph.cljs][github-url] extends JSXGraph with a [React][react-url] /
[Reagent][reagent-url] component that makes it easy to define JSXGraph
constructions inside of a user interface built with Clojurescript.

## Quickstart

Install `JSXGraph.cljs` into your Clojurescript project using the instructions
at its Clojars page:

[![Clojars Project][clojars]][clojars-url](https://clojars.org/org.mentat/jsxgraph.cljs)

Require `jsxgraph.core` in your namespace:

```clj
(ns my-app
   (:require [jsxgraph.core :as jsx]))
```

Create your first `jsx/JSXGraph` board, populated with two points and an arrow
between them:

```clj
(cljs
 [jsx/JSXGraph {:boundingbox [-3 3 3 -3] :axis true}
  [jsx/Point {:name "A" :size 1 :parents [-1 1]}]
  [jsx/Point {:id "B" :name "BEE!" :size 1 :parents [2 -1]}]
  [jsx/Arrow {:size 4
              :parents ["A" "B"]}]])
```

Here's a more complex example of an interactive vector field, implemented
[here](https://jsxgraph.mentat.org/#Vector%20Field):

See the project's [interactive documentation
notebook](https://jsxgraph.mentat.org) for more guides and examples.

## Canvas Dependency

The [JSXGraph NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsxgraph) depends on
the [canvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas) package.
[canvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas) comes with many pre-built
binaries, but if you're running on a non-supported OS or processor architecture
NPM may try to compile this dependency from source.

If you run into trouble, [see the `canvas` docs page on
compilation](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas#compiling) for
instructions on how to install the dependencies for this process.

## Clerk Support

If you want to use `JSXGraph.cljs` with [Clerk][clerk-url], check out the
[`jsxgraph/clerk` template][jsxgraph-clerk-template-url]. This
[`deps-new`][deps-new-url] template will generate a Clerk project for you, fully
configured to use `JSXGraph.cljs` in your Clerk notebooks.

## Interactive Documentation via Clerk

The project's [interactive documentation](https://jsxgraph.mentat.org) was
generated using Nextjournal's [Clerk][clerk-url]. If
you'd like to edit or play with the documentation, you'll need to install

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- The [clojure command line tool](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure)
- [Babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka#installation)

Once this is done, run this command:

```sh
bb clerk-watch
```

This will open a browser window to `http://localhost:7777` with the contents of
the documentation notebook. Any edits you make to `dev/jsxgraph/notebook.clj` will
be picked up and displayed in the browser on save.
